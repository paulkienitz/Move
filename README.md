# Move

Move is an Amiga CLI command, which acts as a replacement for the Rename command.  It is both more convenient and more powerful.  See the file Move.doc (which is plain text, not a Word doc) for details of its features.

This was the very first Amiga utility I ever started coding, and yet it was the last to be released, as I never quite got it 100% finished for all use cases, though it was close enough that I was using it daily without noticing the shortcomings.  When the manual says "Release 1.2", the word *release* is... an exaggeration.  I should have made it public a long long time ago.

I am omitting a lot of ancillary source files which were used in early versions or for tests and analysis, and including only the working program.  I may still give this an update after I work through all the test cases.

No license, use however you like.
