# Move

Move is an Amiga CLI command, which acts as a replacement for the Rename command.  It is both more convenient and more powerful.  See the file Move.doc (which is plain text, not a Word doc) for details of its features.  The main thing to know is that it requires AmigaDOS 2.x; I had versions that ran in 1.x, but getting it back to where it can run there will be a challenge.

This was the very first Amiga utility I ever started coding, and yet it was the last to be released, as I never quite got it 100% finished for all use cases, though it was close enough that I was using it daily without noticing the shortcomings.  I should have made it public a long long time ago.

For Move 1.4 I am including the source for my Temparse library, which was used to restore compatibility with AmigaDOS 1.2 and 1.3 in a codebase which had long since abandoned it.  The source for this is in the temparse subdirectory.

Note that the correct character set for the source files is ISO-8859-1, and this applies to the .doc files as well.

No license, use however you like.
